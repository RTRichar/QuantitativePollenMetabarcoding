# Quantitative Pollen Metabarcoding

This repository contains plant trnL, trnH, rbcL and ITS2 reference sequence databases as well as the commands used to generate and evaluate their quality. It is associated with the manuscript entitled 'Quantitative multi-locus metabarcoding and waggle dance interpretation reveal honey bee spring foraging patterns in Midwest agroecosystems' (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/418590). Generally, commands are provided such that readers can work through our analyses independently and apply the approach to their own endeavors. It should be noted that the syntax, commands and software used may not be entirely transferrable for future applications given differences in computational architecture, software updates, etc. Further, these commands are given without guidance in terms of directory organization, which we leave at the discretion of the reader. Lastly, due to the ease of transferring commands from one analysis to another, we do not provide commands for every analysis performed in the paper and we assume users are sufficiently fluent to overcome troubleshooting issues that routinely occur during any extensive, large-scale data manipulation.
